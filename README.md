# malaria-classification

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective and Description
The purpose of this project is to save humans by detecting Image Cells that contain Malaria. Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick, with a high fever and shaking chills. Each year, approximately 210 million people are infected with malaria, and about 440,000 people die from the disease. Most of the people who die from the disease are young children in Africa. Diagnosis of malaria can be difficult. Malaria parasites can be identified by examining under the microscope a drop of the patient’s blood, spread out as a “blood smear” on a microscope slide. Prior to examination, the specimen is stained to give the parasites a distinctive appearance. This technique remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of malaria. However, it depends on the quality of the reagents, of the microscope, and on the experience of the laboratorian. I'm building a Convolutional Neural Network to categorize cells as infected or uninfected.
